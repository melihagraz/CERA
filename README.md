## Overview
CERA (ChatGPT-Enhanced ROC Analysis) is a user-friendly web tool developed to facilitate the analysis of ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curves and determination of optimal cutoff points in biomarker analysis. It leverages the power of ChatGPT to interpret analysis outputs, enhancing accessibility and understanding for users without coding experience.

## Features
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Utilizes the Shiny framework for an intuitive web-based interface.
- **ChatGPT Integration**: Provides interpreted analysis reports, enhancing the understanding of ROC curve analysis results.
- **Multiple Analysis Options**: Supports various methods for finding optimal cutoff points, including Youdenâ€™s index, closest top-left, and minimum p-value approaches.
- **Data Upload**: Allows users to upload their own data or select from example datasets for analysis.

## Installation
No installation required. Access the tool directly at [https://datascicence.shinyapps.io/ROCGPT/](https://datascicence.shinyapps.io/ROCGPT/).

## Usage
1. **Data Preparation**: Prepare your dataset in a compatible format.
2. **Data Upload**: Upload your data or select an example dataset.
3. **Analysis**: Choose your analysis method and run the ROC analysis.
4. **Report Generation**: Generate and download the analysis report, enhanced with interpretations from ChatGPT.
